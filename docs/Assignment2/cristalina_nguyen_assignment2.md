### Problem 1:
What are the two major concerns of any software project?
- The two major concerns of any software project are time and money.

Which do you feel is more important?
- I feel that money is more important. Without resources to fund your project and development, it does not matter how much time you have on your hands. 

Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?
- Complete functionality is when you are not lacking time or money, with both an appropriate budget and a reasonable time period for work, your project is ready to go!

### Problem 2:
In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.
- The four main phases that occur in each and every iteration are building requirements, designing, writing code, and testing! I believe that requirements could (for the most part) be written at the beginning of the project, but during each iteration they should be checked to ensure that design or code changes made do not contradict original requirements. By doing all phases are once and not in each iteration you are leaning towards a waterfall methodology and risk scope/feature creep and falling behind. Therefore, you should always try your best to repeat each phase during every iteration.

### Problem 3: 
In the Waterfall method for software development, what are the main phases that occur? How are they different from the phases in the Agile method? What other phases are in Waterfall that are left out of Agile? Do you think these are needed in Waterfall? Describe a situation using Agile in which one of these extra Waterfall phases might be needed.
- In the waterfall method for software development the phases are the same, but each one is completed before the next one can be started and each one is only completed once. This is different from agile in that there are no iterations so once you move on from requirements to design, you never go back to re-evaluate the requirements.

### Problem 4:
What is a user story?
- A user story is a story about how users will interact with the software you are building.

What is blueskying?
-	Blueskying is brainstorming with other people and capturing any and all ideas thrown your way. 

What are four things that user stories SHOULD do?
-	User stories should describe one thing that the software needs to do for the customer, should be written using language that the customer understands, should be written by the customer, and should be short.

What are three things that user stories SHOULD NOT do?
-	User stories should not be a long essay, should not use technical terms that are unfamiliar to the customer, and should not mention specific technologies.

### Problem 5:
**What is your opinion on the following statements, and why do you feel that way?**

All assumptions are bad, and no assumption is a good assumption.
-	I believe that the only bad assumption is the one that is not talked about. The only way that an assumption can negatively impact a product is if it is not addressed to clarify whether or not it is going to help you make decisions or it is impacting the decisions you are trying to make. If you an address an assumption, you are ridding it from your project and figuring out what you don’t know.

A big user story estimate is a bad user story estimate.
-	The size of a user story estimate has nothing to do with whether it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’, if it is big and correct, so be it! As long as the estimate is carefully planned and thought through. However, a good thing to keep in mind is that if the user story estimate is abnormally large, it is probably wrong or should be broken up into multiple smaller user stories, to allow less room for error.

### Problem 6:
You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: **User story**

The more of me there are, the clearer things become: **User story**

I help you capture EVERYTHING: **Blueskying, Observation**

I help you get more from the customer: **Observation, Role playing**

In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: **Observation**

Some people say I'm arrogant, but really, I'm just about confidence: **Estimate**

Everyone's involved when it comes to me: **Blueskying**

### Problem 7:
Explain what is meant by a better than best-case estimate.
- 

### Problem 8:
In your opinion, when would be the best time to tell your customer that you will NOT be able to meet her delivery schedule? Why do you feel that is the best time? Do you think that would be a difficult conversation?
- As soon as you can confidently say you cannot get a certain amount of work done in a certain amount of time. If that requires more thinking and estimation, then you consult with the customer about the delivery schedule after. If the customer provides a delivery schedule right off the bat that you know you could not meet, tell them immediately. It may be a difficult conversation depending on how you phrase it, how you come across, and how the customer receives it, but it is a conversation that must be had regardless.

### Problem 9:
Discuss why you think branching in your software configuration is bad or good. Describe a scenario to support your opinion.
- I think that incorporating branching in your software configuration is great, because otherwise it would be impossible for people to work on and commit code at the same time. Many teams have more than one software engineer, and lots of code that has been built over time, and branches are the perfect way to cleanly update code from multiple people without committing all at once (which would not even work without damaging the code) and ensuring that it all works.

### Problem 10:
Have you used a build tool in your development? Which tool have you used? What are its good points? What are it's bad points?
-	I have not used a build tool in development because I have mostly only worked on the product management side, but I am excited to possibly use one for our 401 project once we get started coding!
