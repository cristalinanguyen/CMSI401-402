*1.	Write a short paragraph to answer these three questions: What are the two major concerns of any software project? Which do you feel is more important? Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?*

The two major concerns of any software project are: how much will it cost, and how long will it take?
I believe the most important is the question of how long it will take. Time is always a huge constraint and customers usually want things produced quickly. Most products will have launch dates and it is important that these deadlines are met. I don’t believe that cost is as important since it is usually not extremely difficult to find individuals to fund a project. If a person wants something to be developed, they will go out of their way to find enough revenue to produce a successful project. Complete functionality involves these two questions as the product needs to follow through on the software requirements and ensure they are delivered on time and on budget. 

*2.	In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.*

In each and every iteration, individuals need to estimate new features, have the customer prioritize the new features, rework your iteration plan, and check your project deadline. Feedback given in each iteration is really important. I don’t feel as though any of these could be removed from an iteration. Effective and frequent communication is important and ensures that each team member is on the same page and up to date on all information. Taking one of these out could cause issues with that iteration. It can end up not saving time but adding time if something goes wrong and a team has to backtrack. It is always necessary to discuss new features and prioritize these with a plan keeping all deadlines in mind. 

*3.	In the Waterfall method for software development, what are the main phases that occur? How are they different from the phases in the Agile method? What other phases are in Waterfall that are left out of Agile? Do you think these are needed in Waterfall? Describe a situation using Agile in which one of these extra Waterfall phases might be needed.*

In the waterfall method, the main phases are conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation, and maintenance. The outcome of each phase acts as the input for the next and each phase will only begin if the previous is complete. Agile is different than waterfalls phases since it has short sprint lifecycles. Because of this agile is more flexible and can add things as the project progresses. In the waterfall method, typically all requirements are set before the project development starts. Since agile has short cycles, they do not have a maintenance step. This step may be needed when developing software such as a web app since all pages will be developed separately, they may need to be maintained and updated in an iteration once more pages are added. 

*4.	Write one-sentence answers to the following questions:*
•	What is a user story?
o	A user story is a story about how users interact with the software you’re building written from the customers perspective. 
•	What is blueskying?
o	 Blueskying is when you brainstorm requirements with multiple people and come up with wild ideas. 
•	What are four things that user stories SHOULD do?
o	User stories should: describe one thing that the software needs to do for the customer, be written using language that the customer understands, be written by the customer, and be short 
•	What are three things that user stories SHOULD NOT do?
o	User stories should not: be a long essay, use technical terms that are unfamiliar to the customer, and mention specific technologies. 

*5.	What is your opinion on the following statements, and why do you feel that way:*

All assumptions are bad, and no assumption is a good assumption.
-	I do not think assumptions are a good thing, because you never know if your customer is thinking on the same page. I think you should always try to clarify when you can, however, if this is not possible (the customer is unsure what they want as well), then I think it is okay to make an assumption. This should just be noted as an assumption and discussed in the next iteration to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Eliminating assumptions should always be the goal. 

A big user story estimate is a bad user story estimate.
-	I think that if someone has a very large estimate on how long it will take to develop a user story, it may just mean they are not on the same page as everyone else. This can be a helpful sign that more communication is needed so they can better understand the deliverable. It will help to create clarity within the team and may be a sign that the user story needs to be revisited. 
-	However, I think that a big user story estimate should be broken down into multiple parts. I always like to simplify things by breaking them down into smaller pieces. I think this helps to ensure that tasks are being done correctly. A larger estimate leaves less time for correcting any errors which may arise. 

*6.	Fill in the blanks in the statements below, using the following things [you can use each thing for more than one statement]: Blueskying; Role playing; Observation; User story; Estimate; Planning poker.*

You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: User story
The more of me there are, the clearer things become: User story
I help you capture EVERYTHING: Blueskying, observation 
I help you get more from the customer: Role playing, observation 
In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: Observation
Some people say I'm arrogant, but really, I'm just about confidence: Planning poker, estimate
Everyone's involved when it comes to me: Blueskying 
NOTE: when you have finished, check your answers with the result in your text on page 62. Do you agree with the book answers? If you disagree with any of them, justify your preferred answer.
I agree with all of the answers but believe that the 6th can also be planning poker. This is when each member of the team will place down a card with the number of days they believe it will take to complete a deliverable. Individuals will need to be confident with their decisions If they believe this is truly how long it will take. It goes hand in hand with an estimate. 

*7.	Explain what is meant by a better than best-case estimate.*

This is when programmers give estimates with lots of assumptions in mind such as no mistakes made, and no tests are run. They are thinking in utopian days. 

*8.	In your opinion, when would be the best time to tell your customer that you will NOT be able to meet her delivery schedule? Why do you feel that is the best time? Do you think that would be a difficult conversation?*

I think as early as possible, or as soon as you know that you won’t be able to meet the delivery schedule, you should tell your customer. This is the best time because it helps you get ahead to start planning the new timeline with them. If you wait, then you will be wasting valuable time working on a project you’re not even sure if the customer will still want if it can’t be delivered on their desired date. This will definitely be a difficult conversation, but I believe that the you will gain more respect from the customer if you are honest and communicate with them early on about the problem. Hopefully the customer will understand that the work can get done, just not in the time frame proposed. 

*9.	Discuss why you think branching in your software configuration is bad or good. Describe a scenario to support your opinion.*

I think branching is a great idea in software configuration. This allows for more than one developer to be working on a part of the project at the same time. If you don’t branch, then individuals cannot work and commit on the same code at the same time. This semester, my group has more than one software engineer. Branching has allowed us to update code from multiple people without messing up this code. 

*10.	Have you used a build tool in your development? Which tool have you used? What are its good points? What are its bad points?*

So far this semester in 401 I have not used any build tools. I have mainly been working on documents and focusing on the project management side of the project.
