## Problem 1:
*What are the two major concerns of any software project?*

The two major concerns that teams focus on when working on a software project are time and money.

*Which do you feel is more important?*

Obviously, if you don’t have time to develop a project *well*, you probably won’t come out with the best product possible. However, I would say that money is more important because without the funding, it’s quite possible that you’ll never have access to the resources you need to build your product in the first place, no matter how much time you have to spend working on it.

*Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?*

Complete functionality means you aren’t blocked due to a lack of time or money. You are able to have your project completed with the funding you need and a reasonable amount of time to work on it.
