## Problem 1:
*What are the two major concerns of any software project?*

The two major concerns that teams focus on when working on a software project are time and money.

*Which do you feel is more important?*

Obviously, if you don’t have time to develop a project *well*, you probably won’t come out with the best product possible. However, I would say that money is more important because without the funding, it’s quite possible that you’ll never have access to the resources you need to build your product in the first place, no matter how much time you have to spend working on it.

*Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?*

Complete functionality means you aren’t blocked due to a lack of time or money. You are able to have your project completed with the funding you need and a reasonable amount of time to work on it.

## Problem 2:
*In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.*

The four main phases that occur in every iteration in the Agile method are building requirements, designing, writing code, and testing. I think that each of these steps is there for a reason. If you don’t spend time reviewing the requirements at the beginning of the iteration, and evaluating if you need to add any more to the list of requirements, you can be led astray from the real mission of the project. Designing needs to at least be reviewed at every iteration to make sure it still aligns with the project and works well for the users. Code needs to be updated to support any new requirements or designs and testing is a must at every iteration because you need to ensure that your product still works. Even if skipping a step could save time, it would be irresponsible because it could lead the project astray from the original goal and result in having to backtrack and spend even more time on the project than you had planned in the first place.

## Problem 3: 
*In the Waterfall method for software development, what are the main phases that occur? How are they different from the phases in the Agile method? What other phases are in Waterfall that are left out of Agile? Do you think these are needed in Waterfall? Describe a situation using Agile in which one of these extra Waterfall phases might be needed.*

The main phases that occur in the Waterfall method are requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. These phases are only done once, and each one must be completed before moving on to the next one. I do believe that all of these phases are necessary for the Waterfall method especially because each phase is only done once, so you need to be thorough to make sure everything goes right. I think that system maintenance could be a useful addition to the Agile method. Once a system/product is out there, it needs to be maintained at the same time that it is being iterated upon and improved. I’m not sure that maintenance should be added as a step in the cycle as much as it should be something that happens in parallel.

## Problem 4:
*What is a user story?*

A user story is a story about how a user will interact with the software/product you are builiding.

*What is blueskying?*

Blueskying is when you brainstorm with others to get new ideas (any and all that come your way).

*What are four things that user stories SHOULD do?*

User stories should describe something the software needs to do for the user/customer, should be written by a user, should be written using language that the user understands, and should be relatively short and succinct in order to get the main points across.

*What are three things that user stories SHOULD NOT do?*

User stories should not be extremely long, should not use technical terms that a user would not understand, and should not mention specific technologies.

## Problem 5:
*What is your opinion on the following statements, and why do you feel that way?*

> All assumptions are bad, and no assumption is a good assumption.

I think that the issue with assumptions is that they are not communicated about how they should be. There are plenty of assumptions that get made every day that are based on knowledge about users and software that are in fact good assumptions and align with how most users/developers feel about a product. However, no matter what the assumption is, it is important to clarify it with your team if it is affecting any choices you are making in the development process. If communication is happening the way it should, bad assumptions don’t slip through the cracks, and everyone can be on the same page.

> A big user story estimate is a bad user story estimate.

As long as a user story estimate is accurate and has been well thought out, the story should be considered to be a good one, not a bad one. However, when a user story estimate is *extremely* large, that could be an indicator that it needs to be looked at again and maybe even broken up into multiple user stories.

### Problem 6:
*Fill in the blanks.*

You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: `User story`

The more of me there are, the clearer things become: `User story`

I help you capture EVERYTHING: `Blueskying, Observation`

I help you get more from the customer: `Role playing, Observation`

In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: `Observation`

Some people say I'm arrogant, but really, I'm just about confidence: `Estimate`

Everyone's involved when it comes to me: `Blueskying`
