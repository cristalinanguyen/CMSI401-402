## Problem 1:
*What are the two major concerns of any software project?*

The two major concerns that teams focus on when working on a software project are time and money.

*Which do you feel is more important?*

Obviously, if you don’t have time to develop a project *well*, you probably won’t come out with the best product possible. However, I would say that money is more important because without the funding, it’s quite possible that you’ll never have access to the resources you need to build your product in the first place, no matter how much time you have to spend working on it.

*Where does the idea of complete functionality fit with these two concerns?*

Complete functionality means you aren’t blocked due to a lack of time or money. You are able to have your project completed with the funding you need and a reasonable amount of time to work on it.

## Problem 2:
*In the Agile method for software development, what are the four main phases that occur in each and every iteration? Do you feel that any of them could be done at the start of the project and not be repeated in every iteration? Do you feel that would save time overall on the project? Justify your answers with a brief explanation.*

The four main phases that occur in every iteration in the Agile method are building requirements, designing, writing code, and testing. I think that each of these steps is there for a reason. If you don’t spend time reviewing the requirements at the beginning of the iteration, and evaluating if you need to add any more to the list of requirements, you can be led astray from the real mission of the project. Designing needs to at least be reviewed at every iteration to make sure it still aligns with the project and works well for the users. Code needs to be updated to support any new requirements or designs and testing is a must at every iteration because you need to ensure that your product still works. Even if skipping a step could save time, it would be irresponsible because it could lead the project astray from the original goal and result in having to backtrack and spend even more time on the project than you had planned in the first place.
