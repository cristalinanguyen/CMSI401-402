Hi, all ~~~~

The poster is LOVELY!!  I like the colors, the layout [2 panel vs 3 panel] and the top/bottom bracketed format.  The language describes the problem and solution very well!

I'm wondering if you realize that with a 48" X 36" space you can actually fit a lot more information on here, but in light of your overall minimalist vision for everything else, this is very reflective of what you've done all semester.

Nice work!
