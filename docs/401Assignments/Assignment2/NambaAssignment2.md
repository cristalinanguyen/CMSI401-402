### Problem 1
1. Time and money: how much it will cost and how long it will take.
2. Between the two I think time is more important. This is because you can never buy more time, however you can always find more funding.
3. Complete functionality fits in because in order to make sure the project has full functionality, you must be sure that you spent enough time on the project, and you have enough funding to make it work. Both time and money are necessary for the project to functionally complete.

### Problem 2
1. The four main stages are plan, build, test, review. I think that if any of the stages could be done at the start of the project it would be the planning stage. If you planned out the entire project prior, each sprint could be focusing on developing and testing. The only downside is that planning every aspect of a project is difficult. Problems and features that you didn’t think of may arise during your actual development of the project. So I don’t think this is a very good idea.

### Problem 3
1. In the waterfall method, the main stages are: design, develop, test, and maintenance. The stages are the same as the agile method, however the timing is different. In agile you cycle through the stages multiple times except each cycle focuses on a different part of the project. In agile, you do not have to plan out every aspect of the project before starting development, this can save a lot of time because you can start development and not get hung up on some problems in the design or planning. 

### Problem 4
1. User stories define the ‘what’ of the project. It should capture fully what the project is and what should it accomplish.
2. Blue-skying is basically brainstorming with the customer. It is going through the project and trying to flesh out all of the requirements. There are no wrong answers when doing this as long as they are relevant to the core project.
3. User stories should: describe one thing the software needs to do, be written in language that the customer understands, be written by the customer, be short.
4. User stories should not: be a long essay, use technical terms, mention specific technologies.

### Problem 5
1. I don’t agree that all assumptions are bad. I think if the assumption is backed by logic and evidence it can hold weight and should be considered. Random assumptions with no backing should definitely not be taken into account, those I would consider bad assumptions.
2. I think that since the user estimate is comprised of user stories, the more user stories available the more accurate the estimate. So no, I disagree with the statement.

### Problem 6
You can dress me up as a use case for a formal occasion: User Stories
The more of me there are, the clearer things become: User Stories
I help you capture EVERYTHING: Blueskying
I help you get more from the customer: BlueSkying
In court, I'd be admissible as firsthand evidence: Observations
Some people say I'm arrogant, but really I'm just about confidence: Estimate
Everyone's involved when it comes to me: Blue Skying
My only different answer was the fourth answer. I think that blue-skying can help you get more from the customer because it involves everyone and it can bring up things that no one may have thought of previously.

### Problem 7
There are three estimates generally used. Worst-case, which is when revenue and results are the worst. Probable-case, which is when revenue is moderate. Best-case, which is when the result is best and the revenue is the best. A better-than-best-case is an estimate which exceeds the best case estimation.

### Problem 8
I think the best time to tell the customer this is when you are absolutely sure that you will not be able to make the deadline. Once you are sure of this, then telling the customer as soon as possible would be ideal. This way they can have plenty of time to adjust things on their end. I think this conversation would be difficult and uncomfortable, but it is one that is necessary and important. 

### Problem 9
I think branching is a good idea, as long as the version control is robust and no errors occur. There are many times when multiple developers need the same code base, and need to work on different parts of the project in parallel. In cases like these it would be ideal to branch the code so that they can all work simultaneously. Also if they developers are not all in the same location, branching would be a very helpful tool. 

### Problem 10
I have not had any experience with a build tool. If Jenkins counts as sum subcategory of a build tool then yes, I’ve used a build tool before. However I only used Jenkins for its linter property in CMSI 186.
