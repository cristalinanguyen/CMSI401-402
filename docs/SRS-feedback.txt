USChedule Project SRS Feedback
==============================

Damn, you guys.... this is literally one of the best SRS submissions I've seen.

Seriously, you have everything in here, and you nailed it all.  The only thing you
need to do is split the first requirement for each CSC into a header and a single
requirement statement.  For example:

   5.3.1    Graphical User Interface (GUI)
   5.3.1.1  The GUI shall display a login page

The subsequent requirements need to be renumbered to add one to each statement, so
5.3.1.1 becomes 5.3.1.2 and so on.  This should be a trivial exercise, but the
result will be clearly defined sections for the requirements for each of the CSC's
in the project.

Other than that, AWESOME!!

Make the changes listed above by the end of the semester for full credit on this assignment.

Initial submission 8% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      10% out of 10% = 100% which is an A-plus
