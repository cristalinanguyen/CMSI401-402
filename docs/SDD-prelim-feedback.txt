VERY nice work, as always.  You guys just keep getting better at this!  You
have plenty of detail at the architectural level.  Just a couple of small
observations:

The professionalism you show in the text of the document is somewhat cut down
by the hand-drawn diagrams.  It would be better to have a drawing program of
some stripe to do those.  They DO look good in terms of content, it's just
that they detract from the overall niceness of the document.

Second, in the last diagram the use cases should NOT include the algorithm.
That is actually an "actor" and should be drawn as such.  Also, the ellipse
labeled "database access object class" should be an actor.

Other than that, great work!

you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
